This course was mainly focused in build an app with both react and express technologies, therefore, it's neither an app that looks pretty nor one that has many functionalities. 
These are the topics that were addressed in the course in depth:
1. Joining the react architecture with express in development and in production environments.
2. Paying with the Stripe library.
3. Sending a bunch of emails from the app.
4. Working in development and production environments.
